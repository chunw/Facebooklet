GAME INTRODUCTION
***************
This site serves an online game where user 
can interact with his friends by answering private questions 
about them and thus earning 'friendship credits.'

To access the game, create two accounts and make them friends.
Log in as user1 and view user's profile and choose to 
¡°answer questions to earn friendship credits. This will bring 
up the game interface in the center region where user1 can 
answer one at a time of the questions randomly generated 
from a question bank to win friendship credits. A question
for this purpose, each tied with a specific credit value, is a 
test to the friendship bound between the current user and his 
friend. For each question, input the answer, and use the "submit 
answer" button to send a credit request and submit the answer
for user2 to review. Please note that user1 has to be added as
user2's friend in order to be able to play this game. Use 
"continue answering questions" for more chances to answer 
questions and earn credits.

To review user1's answers, log in as user2 and click on "view
my wall". The list of credit requests should be displayed 
on the wall and after reviewing each question and answer, choose
either "add credits" if the answer is deemed correct or "disregard"
if not. A credit report is located underneath the request list
and a "view/hide my credit report" button is provided to make the
report appear or disappear. Since the friendship credits should 
be awarded mutually, check user1's credit report as well to 
make sure user1 is awarded the same number of credits as user2.


-Enjoy!
